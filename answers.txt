Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Some reasons that we will use Git is because of the versatility
that can be added for our code. Git is very useful when is comes to Version
control over Code. This is especially helpful when experimenting with different
functions, code snippets, etc. Collaboration is also very massive with Git. I
could be working within a repository at the same time as someone else and we
could each be seeing their new updated code. Overall Git makes many coding
headaches go away and is very simple to learn.



Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: The first field that pops into my mind would be within Healthcare.
Data Science relies on the analysis of data in order to make conclusions about
patient's diagnosis and care. Data science can be used to analyze paitent
records and predict which paitents are at higher risk of developing diseases
like diabetes or heart failure


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging and rebasing do very similar things: combining changes from
one branch to another, however, they each will do it differently. With Merging,
it will create a merge commit which will tie the history of the two together.
This will keep the history intact, such as seeing where both branches and where
they joined. Rebasing will replay you commits onto the tip of a branch which
will make your history look linear and cleaner to look at.
