Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Some reasons that we will use Git is because of the versatility 
that can be added for our code. Git is very useful when is comes to Version 
control over Code. This is especially helpful when experimenting with different
functions, code snippets, etc. Collaboration is also very massive with Git. I
could be working within a repository at the same time as someone else and we
could each be seeing their new updated code. Overall Git makes many coding
headaches go away and is very simple to learn.
