Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a great tool for us as computer science students because it 
allows us to control the versions of code that we publish. Along with that, Git
makes collaborations on coding projects much easier and will update accordingly
. In terms of this class, where we have a project that we will be sharing with 
each other, and we will be running experiements. It will make this class much
easier. 



Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: The first field that pops into my mind would be within Healthcare.
Data Science relies on the analysis of data in order to make conclusions about
patient's diagnosis and care. Data science can be used to analyze paitent
records and predict which paitents are at higher risk of developing diseases
like diabetes or heart failure

Answer: Some reasons that we will use Git is because of the versatility 
that can be added for our code. Git is very useful when is comes to Version 
control over Code. This is especially helpful when experimenting with different
functions, code snippets, etc. Collaboration is also very massive with Git. I
could be working within a repository at the same time as someone else and we
could each be seeing their new updated code. Overall Git makes many coding
headaches go away and is very simple to learn.
